Array-Refs: work

schema with no-refs, only cascaded in root: works

schema with referenced 'types' and types defined cascaded in schema root:
rendering (with jsonforms) of referenced types works.
rendering of cascaded types does not work:
the schema given to jsonforms is not self-contained:
It was not made self-contained with own definitions during the clean up.

self recursion (from recursion.ts):
rendering of the root does not work because the schema of the droppoint for the cascaded property
that references the recursive type is not self-contained when it's "cut out" of the root schema
